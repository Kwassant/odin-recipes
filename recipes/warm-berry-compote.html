    <h3>The Warm Berry Compote recipe from Allrecipes involves cooking frozen mixed berries with sugar, orange juice, and orange zest in a slow cooker until bubbling. A cornstarch and water mixture is then added to thicken the compote. This warm berry sauce can be served on its own or as a topping for desserts like ice cream.</h3>
