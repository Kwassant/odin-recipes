    <h3>Gyudon, as detailed in the recipe from Damn Delicious, involves simmering thinly sliced beef and onions in a flavorful mix of soy sauce, mirin, sake, and sugar until tender. The beef and onions are then served over a bed of steamed rice, garnished with green onions and pickled ginger for added flavor and texture. This dish is quick to prepare and deeply comforting, making it a staple in Japanese cuisine.</h3>
